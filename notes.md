Angular is a powerful and versatile platform for building web applications.
Angular involves understanding TypeScript, components, modules, decorators, services, dependency injection, routing, HTTP requests, pipes, observables, and more.

Basic pre-requisites: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
TypeScript: Angular is built on TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions. It's vital to learn it.
You should understand types, interfaces, classes, decorators, and other TypScript features.

Components : fondamental building blocks of Angular applications. They display data on the screen, listen for user input, and take action based on that input.
@NgModules : provide a compilation context for components. They collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules.
FormsModule: provides the ngModel directive, which enables two-way data binding.
RouterModule: provides the router-outlet directive and the Routes array that enable navigation from one view to the next as users perform application tasks.
Directives: Classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. They are the basic building blocks of Angular applications.
Understand built-in directives and how to create custom ones.
Services and Dependency Injection: Services are classes that provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
Forms and Validation: Forms are a critical part of most web applications, collecting data from the user and validating that data. Angular provides two ways to work with forms: template-driven forms and reactive forms, the latter also sometimes called model-driven forms.
HTTP and Observables: Angular applications need to communicate with servers to request and receive data. Angular provides the HttpClient service, which enables requests to and from external resources via HTTP.
Routing and Navigation: Routing enables navigation from one view to the next as users perform application tasks. The Angular Router NgModule provides a service that lets you define a navigation path among the different application states and view hierarchies in your app.
Testing: Write unit tests and end-to-end tests using Jasmine, Karma, and Protractor.
Change detection and Zone.js: Understand how Angular keeps track of data changes and how it uses Zone.js to trigger change detection.
Pipes: Pipes are a useful feature in Angular. They allow you to transform data before displaying it in a view.
Angular libraries: Understand how to create and deploy Angular libraries.
Build and deployment: Understand how to build and deploy Angular applications.
Project: Best way to learn is by doing. Consider building a full-fledged application using Angular. It will help you understand the concepts better and gets hands-on experience.

Throughout your learning journey, you should be coding and practicing regularly. Keep building small projects or components.

npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-app
cd impavi-de && ng serve --open
ng generate component my-component
ng g c my-component
